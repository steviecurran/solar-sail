Calculate interstellar travel time for a solar sail

Simplifed python version of the C code used for "`Oumuamua as a light sail: Evidence against artificial origin" (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...649L..17C/abstract), showing that the decrease in acceleration with distance from the power source (the Sun) results in an effective terminal velocity. This means that even for a huge, ultra-light, efficient sail with a modest payload, interstellar travel would take millennia, rather than decades.
